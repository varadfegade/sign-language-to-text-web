# Sign Language to Text Converter

## Features
- Real-time ASL recognition (basic subset – extendable to full alphabet).
- Interactive "Learn Gestures" modal with images, descriptions, and tips.
- Modern responsive UI with dark-transparent modal.
- Fully client-side implementation (HTML, CSS, JS) – no backend.
